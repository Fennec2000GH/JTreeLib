Purpose
------- 

This project aims to allow programmers and software enthusiasts to conveniently apply trees and similar data structures without the need to start from scratch. The repository offers diverse types of tree structures such as binary search trees, tries, heaps, and more. Additionally, numerous auxiliary functions allow easy editing of a tree's structure and classify a tree under specific categories by checking for criteria.
